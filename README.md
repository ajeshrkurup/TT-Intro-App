StealJS requires that you serve the assets from an http server. If you do not have one, try the npm [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), which we have provided in this project already. To you use it, in your terminal cd to the directory and run ``` ./node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server ./ ``` if you want it to open your browser with the project for you just add ``` -o ```

In the browser, these javascript files will get cached, so to always get the most recent version of the javascript files, you can either clear your cache each time, or you can try using the google chrome extension [Cache Killer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cache-killer/jpfbieopdmepaolggioebjmedmclkbap?hl=en)
